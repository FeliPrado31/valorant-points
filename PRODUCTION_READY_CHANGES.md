# Production-Ready Changes Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Changes

### 1. Firebase Security Rules ‚úÖ
**Status**: Already production-ready
- Users can only access their own data (`request.auth.uid == userId`)
- Mission and leaderboard collections are read-only for users
- Proper authentication checks enforced across all collections
- Default deny-all rule for unspecified collections

### 2. Environment Variables for Deployment ‚úÖ
**Status**: Implemented and tested

**Changes Made**:
- Converted `serviceAccountKey.json` to environment variables in `src/lib/firebase-admin.ts`
- Updated `.env.local` with all required Firebase Admin SDK environment variables
- Removed `serviceAccountKey.json` file from repository
- Added service account key patterns to `.gitignore`
- Created `DEPLOYMENT.md` with complete environment variable documentation

**Environment Variables Required for Production**:
```
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY_ID=your_private_key_id
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nyour_private_key_content\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your_service_account_email
FIREBASE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
FIREBASE_CLIENT_X509_CERT_URL=your_cert_url
```

### 3. Profile Page Restrictions ‚úÖ
**Status**: Implemented and tested

**Changes Made**:
- **API Level Protection**: Updated `/api/users` PUT endpoint to prevent Riot ID modification once linked
- **UI Level Protection**: Made Riot ID fields read-only once verified and linked
- **Visual Indicators**: Added clear labels and styling for locked fields
- **User Feedback**: Added informational message explaining why Riot ID is locked

**Specific Restrictions Implemented**:
- ‚úÖ Riot ID becomes immutable once verified and linked (`riotId` data exists)
- ‚úÖ Internal user ID (Clerk ID) is not editable by users
- ‚úÖ Email field is read-only (managed by Clerk)
- ‚úÖ Only username can be modified after Riot ID verification
- ‚úÖ Clear error messages when attempting to modify locked data

## üîí Security Features

### Data Protection
- Users can only access their own data through Firestore security rules
- Riot ID cannot be changed once verified (prevents account hijacking)
- API endpoints validate user ownership before any operations
- Environment variables protect sensitive Firebase credentials

### Authentication & Authorization
- Clerk handles user authentication
- Firebase Admin SDK uses service account for server-side operations
- All API endpoints require valid authentication
- User sessions are managed securely

### Input Validation
- API endpoints validate required fields
- Riot ID verification prevents duplicate linking
- Error handling provides appropriate feedback without exposing sensitive data

## üöÄ Deployment Readiness

### Vercel Deployment
1. Set all environment variables in Vercel dashboard
2. Connect GitHub repository
3. Deploy automatically on push to main branch
4. Firebase Admin SDK will work with environment variables

### Testing Checklist
- ‚úÖ Firebase Admin SDK works with environment variables
- ‚úÖ Profile page restrictions function correctly
- ‚úÖ Riot ID becomes read-only after verification
- ‚úÖ API endpoints enforce data protection rules
- ‚úÖ Error handling provides appropriate feedback

### Security Checklist
- ‚úÖ No sensitive files in repository
- ‚úÖ Environment variables properly configured
- ‚úÖ Firestore security rules tested and verified
- ‚úÖ User data access properly restricted
- ‚úÖ Riot ID immutability enforced

## üìù Next Steps for Production

1. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   - Set all environment variables
   - Test Firebase connectivity
   - Verify all features work in production

2. **Monitor and Maintain**:
   - Monitor Firebase usage and costs
   - Regularly rotate API keys
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Monitor error logs

3. **User Support**:
   - Document Riot ID change policy
   - Provide support contact for account issues
   - Monitor user feedback

## üîß Technical Notes

- Node.js version updated to 20.x for Next.js 15.3.2 compatibility
- `.nvmrc` file added for consistent Node.js version across environments
- All sensitive data moved to environment variables
- Firebase security rules are production-ready and tested
