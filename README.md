# Valorant Points

A mission tracking application for Valorant players.

## Development Methodology

This project uses the **Feature Async Task Methodology** for efficient parallel development. This framework enables multiple developers to work on the same feature simultaneously without merge conflicts.

### üìö Framework Documentation
Complete methodology documentation is available in [`docs/feature-async-task-generation/`](docs/feature-async-task-generation/):

- **[FEATURE_TASK_METHODOLOGY.md](docs/feature-async-task-generation/FEATURE_TASK_METHODOLOGY.md)** - Complete framework guide
- **[TASK_TEMPLATE.md](docs/feature-async-task-generation/TASK_TEMPLATE.md)** - Standardized task templates
- **[VALIDATION_CHECKLIST.md](docs/feature-async-task-generation/VALIDATION_CHECKLIST.md)** - Quality assurance checklists
- **[EXAMPLES.md](docs/feature-async-task-generation/EXAMPLES.md)** - Real-world case studies

### üéØ Key Benefits
- **Zero Merge Conflicts**: File ownership strategy prevents conflicts
- **Parallel Development**: 40-60% faster feature development
- **Consistent Quality**: Built-in validation and testing requirements
- **Scalable Process**: Works for teams of any size

### üöÄ Quick Start for Contributors
1. Read the [methodology guide](docs/feature-async-task-generation/FEATURE_TASK_METHODOLOGY.md)
2. Check for existing `feature-tasks/` folders for active features
3. Follow the task templates for consistent development
4. Use validation checklists to ensure quality

## üìù How to Request Async Task Implementation

This section guides project owners and technical leads on how to effectively request feature implementations using the async task framework.

### üé≠ Role Definition

When requesting async task implementation, define yourself as:
- **Project Owner** or **Technical Lead** with decision-making authority
- **Stakeholder** responsible for feature requirements and acceptance criteria
- **Coordinator** who will oversee the parallel development process

### üìã Two-Prompt Strategy for Augment Agent

Use this optimized two-prompt approach designed specifically for Augment Agent's capabilities:

#### **Prompt 1: Feature Analysis & Technical Review**
Let the agent analyze the codebase and understand the technical implications first.

**Template:**
```
I need to implement [feature name/description] in this project.

**Feature Requirements:**
- [Clear, specific requirement 1]
- [Clear, specific requirement 2]
- [Clear, specific requirement 3]

**User Stories:**
- As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [benefit]
- As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [benefit]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] [Specific, testable criterion 1]
- [ ] [Specific, testable criterion 2]
- [ ] [Specific, testable criterion 3]

**Technical Constraints:**
- [Any technology limitations]
- [Performance requirements]
- [Integration requirements]
- [Security considerations]

Please analyze the current codebase and:
1. Review the existing project structure and technology stack
2. Identify what files/components would need to be created or modified
3. Assess any structural changes required (file moves, routing changes, etc.)
4. Identify potential technical challenges or conflicts
5. Determine what infrastructure/dependencies would be needed

Ask me any clarifying questions about the requirements or if you need me to adjust anything about the feature scope before we proceed to task breakdown.
```

#### **Prompt 2: Async Task Framework Implementation**
After the agent confirms understanding, request the task breakdown.

**Template:**
```
Perfect! Now that you understand the feature and its technical implications, please:

1. **Read and understand the async task framework** documented in `docs/feature-async-task-generation/`
   - Review the methodology for breaking features into parallel tasks
   - Understand the foundation ‚Üí parallel ‚Üí cleanup task structure
   - Study the conflict prevention and validation requirements

2. **Apply the framework to this feature** by creating:
   - A comprehensive foundation setup task that handles ALL infrastructure and structural changes
   - Multiple parallel tasks that can be developed simultaneously without conflicts
   - Clear file ownership boundaries to prevent merge conflicts
   - A cleanup task for final integration and testing

3. **Ensure the task breakdown**:
   - Prevents merge conflicts through clear file ownership
   - Enables true parallel development (3+ developers can work simultaneously)
   - Includes comprehensive validation at each level
   - Handles any structural changes in the foundation task
   - Preserves existing functionality throughout the process

Create the complete task documentation following the framework templates, including detailed implementation steps, validation checklists, and git workflow instructions.
```

### üéØ Best Practices for Augment Agent Requests

#### **Trust the Agent's Analysis**
- Let Augment Agent analyze the codebase directly rather than describing it
- The agent can discover project structure, technology stack, and patterns automatically
- Focus on feature requirements rather than technical implementation details
- Allow the agent to identify potential conflicts and structural changes

#### **Clear Feature Definition**
- Provide specific, measurable requirements
- Include concrete user stories and acceptance criteria
- Define what success looks like objectively
- Specify any business constraints or edge cases

#### **Scope Management**
- Focus on single, cohesive features per request
- Avoid mixing multiple unrelated functionalities
- Clearly state what is NOT included in the scope
- Let the agent determine technical boundaries

#### **Leverage Agent Capabilities**
- Ask the agent to analyze technical implications first
- Request clarifying questions if requirements are unclear
- Let the agent identify potential challenges or conflicts
- Trust the agent to understand the async task framework

#### **Iterative Refinement**
- Use the two-prompt approach for optimal results
- Allow for clarification and adjustment in the first prompt
- Proceed to framework implementation only after confirmation
- Be open to agent suggestions for scope or approach adjustments

### üìö Example Prompt Pairs

#### **Example 1: E-commerce Product Catalog**

**Analysis Prompt:**

### üö® Common Pitfalls to Avoid

#### **Over-Explaining Technical Context**
‚ùå "This is a Next.js 15 app with TypeScript, using Tailwind CSS, deployed on Vercel..."
‚úÖ "I need to implement [feature]" (let the agent analyze the tech stack)

#### **Vague Requirements**
‚ùå "Make the app faster and more user-friendly"
‚úÖ "Reduce page load time to under 2 seconds and achieve 95+ Lighthouse accessibility score"

#### **Scope Creep**
‚ùå "Add user management and also improve the existing dashboard and maybe add some reports"
‚úÖ "Implement user role management with RBAC permissions (separate from dashboard improvements)"

#### **Skipping the Analysis Step**
‚ùå "Create async tasks for [feature]" (jumping straight to implementation)
‚úÖ "Analyze this feature first, then create async tasks" (two-prompt approach)

#### **Unclear Success Criteria**
‚ùå "The feature should work well"
‚úÖ "Feature passes all acceptance criteria, loads in under 3 seconds, and handles 1000 concurrent users"

#### **Not Trusting Agent Capabilities**
‚ùå "You need to check if the project uses React or Vue..."
‚úÖ "Please analyze the codebase and identify the technical implications"

### üéØ Success Indicators

Your request is well-structured when:
- ‚úÖ **Agent understands the feature** after the first prompt
- ‚úÖ **Requirements are clear and measurable** with specific acceptance criteria
- ‚úÖ **Agent asks clarifying questions** if anything is unclear
- ‚úÖ **Technical implications are analyzed** before task breakdown
- ‚úÖ **Scope is focused and well-bounded** on a single cohesive feature
- ‚úÖ **Success criteria are objectively verifiable** and testable

The agent should respond to your first prompt with:
- Analysis of the current codebase structure
- Identification of files/components that need creation or modification
- Assessment of any structural changes required
- Questions about unclear requirements or scope

Following these guidelines ensures efficient async task generation and successful parallel development implementation.
